Diwali â€“ The Festival of Lights

Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the most important and joyful festivals celebrated in India. It represents the victory of light over darkness and good over evil. People across the country celebrate this festival with great happiness and enthusiasm.

Before Diwali, people clean and decorate their homes with colorful lights, diyas, and beautiful rangoli designs. According to the great epic Ramayana, Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya after fourteen years of exile and after defeating the demon king Ravana. The people of Ayodhya welcomed Lord Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana by lighting oil lamps (diyas), and from that day onward, Diwali has been celebrated as the festival of lights.

Diwali is also known for the worship of Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity. On this day, people pray for happiness, peace, and success in their lives. Families come together to exchange sweets, gifts, and warm wishes. Many people also start new business accounts or consider this day as the beginning of a new financial year.

The festival of Diwali is celebrated for five days, and each day has its own importance and traditions. Overall, Diwali teaches us to remove darkness from our hearts and spread light, love, and positivity everywhere. It reminds us to do good deeds and to be thankful for the blessings in our lives.
